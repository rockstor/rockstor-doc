Network File System (NFS)
=========================

Rockstor uses Linux NFS server to support exporting Shares to remote clients
via NFS. Both NFS v3 and v4 are supported. UID and GID mapping for the exported
shares can be handled by manually creating users or by using directory services
like :ref:`ldap`, :ref:`nis`, or :ref:`activedirectory`. While accessing a Share
exported via NFS is straightforward from a Linux or macOS client, we recommend
using :ref:`samba_export` if the Share is to be accessed by a Windows client.
See our :ref:`accessshares` section for further guidance.

To manage NFS exports, click on *NFS* under the *Storage* tab in the Web-UI.
If there is any export already defined, they are displayed in a table. If
there are large number of exports, the table is paginated and the current page
number is displayed below the table along with **Previous** and **Next** buttons.

The display can be sorted by individual columns by clicking small up/down
arrows displayed in each column header.

Below are the main operations possible from the *NFS* view, which
operate on one or more shares and is a convenient way to manage exports for the
entire system.

.. _add_nfs_export:

Add NFS export
--------------

A single NFS export represents a unique combination of clients to which a set
of shares are made accessible via chosen options. Go to the *NFS* view under
the *Storage* tab of the Web-UI and click on **Add NFS Export** button to add
a new NFS export.

   :align: center

Various fields of the form are explained as follows.

* **Shares to export**: Choose one or more shares to be exported.
* **NFS Clients** or **Host String**: This field can be a single host, comma separated host names, hostnames with wildcards or IP networks. This field can be complex. For a detailed explanation, read the `manpage <https://manpages.opensuse.org/Tumbleweed/nfs-kernel-server/exports.5.en.html>`_ of exports.
* **Writable**: Choose ro to make the share(s) available read-only or rw for read-write.
* **Sync**: Sync (synchronous) mode is the default and the norm. For asynchronous IO, select
  async. See the `manpage <https://manpages.opensuse.org/Tumbleweed/nfs-kernel-server/exports.5.en.html>`_ of exports for more information.

.. _edit_nfs_export:

Edit NFS export
---------------

An NFS export can be edited to add or remove a Share or allow different set of
clients to be able to access it. In the displayed table of NFS exports under
the *NFS* view of the Web-UI, click on the **edit** icon of the corresponding
export to edit.

.. _delete_nfs_export:

Delete NFS export
-----------------

In the Web-UI, click on the *Storage* tab to enter the main Storage view. Now
click on *NFS* in the left sidebar to enter *NFS* view. In the displayed table
of NFS exports, click on the **trash** icon of corresponding export to delete
the NFS export; note that this does **not** delete the Rockstor Share.

.. _nfs_advanced_edit:

Advanced edit
-------------

If you would like to use further customization than offered using the :ref:`add_nfs_export`
button, click on the "Advanced Edit" button.

.. image:: /images/interface/storage/file_sharing/nfs_ops/nfs_advanced_edit.png

   :align: center

The top part of the resulting page (see below) lists the NFS exports that have been already created
using the :ref:`add_nfs_export` button. The bottom part of this page, however,
allows you to manually add an NFS export to the :code:`/etc/export` file. As a
result, one or more NFS exports can be added by entering it/them as if you were
directly editing this file. In the example below, we create a new NFS export of
the *share02* Share, with the :code:`rw,sync,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check`
options.

.. image:: /images/interface/storage/file_sharing/nfs_ops/nfs_advanced_edit_form.png

Click the *Submit* button, and the new NFS export(s) will be created.

.. _accessshares_nfs:

Accessing NFS shares
---------------------

.. _accessshares_nfs_linux:

From Unix/Linux
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some Linux distributions offer a graphical tool to streamline the connection
to an NFS export. In openSUSE Leap, for instance, the YaST configuration tool can
be used to setup access to an NFS export; see `openSUSE's documentation <https://doc.opensuse.org/documentation/leap/reference/html/book-reference/cha-nfs.html#sec-nfs-import-yast2>`_ for more
details. Please refer to your distribution's documentation to know if you can use
such graphical tools.

Across all Linux distributions, however, the access to an NFS export can be setup
at the command line. In the example below, we will assume a Rockstor Share named *share01*
has already been exported via NFS as described in the :ref:`add_nfs_export` section
above. We will also assume the Rockstor machine can be resolved in the network under
the hostname *rockstable*. Note that in the examples below, the Rockstor's machine IP
address can be used instead.

First, from the Linux client, we can verify that we can see all NFS shares exported by
the Rockstor machine:

.. code-block:: console

    you@laptop:~> sudo showmount -e rockstable
    Export list for rockstable:
    /export/share01 *

We can see here that the :code:`share01` NFS export is correctly detected. We can thus
proceed with accessing its content. First, we need to create a directory on the client
machine (Linux laptop) that will be used to mount the NFS export.

.. code-block:: console

    you@laptop:~> mkdir -p $HOME/share01

Now, we proceed with mounting the NFS export to this directory:

.. code-block:: console

    you@laptop:~> sudo mount rockstable:/export/share01 $HOME/share01

The Rockstor Share named *share01* is now accessible on the Linux laptop at the
:code:`$HOME/share01` path.

If you would like your Linux laptop to automatically mount this NFS export at startup,
you can manually edit your :code:`/etc/fstab` file to contain the following line:

.. code-block:: console

    rockstable:/export/share01 $HOME/share01 nfs4 rw 0 0

.. note::

    The above can take many important options to control the behavior of this NFS mount.
    See the `nfs mount manpage <https://manpages.opensuse.org/Tumbleweed/nfs-client/nfs.5.en.html>`_ for further details.

.. _accessshares_nfs_macos:

From macOS
^^^^^^^^^^

From a macOS client, an NFS export can be accessed directly from *Finder*. First, open
*Finder* and click on *Go* > *Connect to server*:

.. image:: /images/interface/storage/file_sharing/nfs_ops/nfs_macos_finder_menu.png
   :align: center

Then, enter the path to the NFS export as :code:`nfs://rockstable/export/share01`; note
that the IP address can be used instead of the hostname. This should look as follows:

.. image:: /images/interface/storage/file_sharing/nfs_ops/nfs_macos_connect_server.png
   :align: center

Click *Connect* and the NFS export will now be available directly in *Finder*.

Alternatively, an NFS export can be mounted manually at the command line following the
same instructions :ref:`listed above <accessshares_nfs_linux>`.
