YouTrack Rock-on
=================
Please be aware of the common prerequisites for all Rockstor
:ref:`rockons_intro`; specifically the :ref:`rockons_preinstall` and
:ref:`rockons_root` requirement.

.. _youtrack_whatis:

What is YouTrack
-----------------
YouTrack is a project management tool developed by `JetBrains
<https://www.jetbrains.com/>`_ and aimed at providing development teams with a
fully-featured issue tracker. A full list and demonstration of each feature can
be found on the `project's main page <https://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack/features/>`_.


.. _youtrack_doc:

YouTrack Documentation
-----------------------
YouTrack's `online documentation <https://www.jetbrains.com/help/youtrack/>`_
is a good place to start along with their
`Getting Started guide <https://www.jetbrains.com/help/youtrack/server/getting-started-with-youtrack.html>`_
and their `Blog <https://blog.jetbrains.com/youtrack/>`_.


.. _youtrack_preinstall:

Pre-install requirements
-------------------------
First please consider the pre-requisites for any Rock-on; these are linked to
at the :ref:`top <youtrack_rockon>` of this document. In addition, however,
please note that the YouTrack Rock-on will require setting up a dedicated
**user** as well as **four dedicated shares**. Note that this is in addition to
the :ref:`rockons_root` that may well already have been made.

.. _youtrack_preinstall_shares:

Create dedicated shares
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The YouTrack rock-on requires four dedicated shares (see :ref:`createshare` for
more help), which can be created as follows:

- **Configuration**:  a directory where YouTrack will store configuration files
  that contain environment settings, JVM options, YouTrack integration
  settings, and so on. Create a share named `youtrack-conf`, for instance.
- **Data storage**: directory where YouTrack will store its database. Create a
  share named `youtrack-data`, for instance. This directory **must** be empty.
- **Logs**: a directory where YouTrack will store its log files. Create a share
  named `youtrack-logs`, for instance.
- **Backups**: a directory where YouTrack will store its backups. Create a
  share named `youtrack-backup`, for instance.


.. _youtrack_preinstall_user:

Create a dedicated user
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The YouTrack rock-on uses a specific user account to run the YouTrack service
inside the container (for more information, see `YouTrack's documentation
<https://www.jetbrains.com/help/youtrack/server/youtrack-docker-installation.html#create-and-configure-directories>`_).
While the name of this user account is up to the user's preference, its UID and
GID must be as follows:

- **UID**: 13001
- **GID**: 13001

To create such user account from Rockstor webUI, first navigate to *System* >
*Groups*, and click on **Add Group**. Then, create a new group with the
following options:

.. image:: /images/interface/docker-based-rock-ons/youtrack_groups_create.png
    :width: 100%
    :align: center

Please note that while the group *name* can be set to any name, the **GID must
be 13001**. Similarly, the option to "*Put this group under Rockstor
management*" is optional and can thus be left unchecked if preferred.

Now that we have created the appropriate *group*, we can create proceed with
the creation of the *user*. To do so, navigate to *System* > *Users*, and click
on **Add User**. Then, create a new user with the following options:

.. image:: /images/interface/docker-based-rock-ons/youtrack_users_create.png
    :width: 100%
    :align: center

As mentioned above, all settings *except* the **UID** and **Group** can be
chosen as desired. Indeed, the latter two must be as follows:

- **UID**: 13001
- **Group**: the same as created above (*youtrack-users* in our case)

Finally, we need to set this user as owner of **all four dedicated shares**
created above. To do so, open each share's detail page (see :ref:`shares`
section), navigate to the "`Access control`" tab, click "`Edit`", and set the
user we just created as **owner**. See, for instance, the screenshot below in
which we set the ownership of the *youtrack-backup* share.

.. image:: /images/interface/docker-based-rock-ons/youtrack_access_control.png
    :width: 100%
    :align: center

Please note in the screenshot above that we also changed the *Permissions* to
**750** by unchecking the *Read* and *Write* permissions for *Others*. While
this is not necessary to YouTrack's function, it provides enhanced security and
is the recommended setting in
`YouTrack's documentation <https://www.jetbrains.com/help/youtrack/server/youtrack-docker-installation.html#create-and-configure-directories>`_.



.. _youtrack_install:

Installing YouTrack Rock-on
----------------------------

Before proceeding with the YouTrack rock-on installation, please ensure all
steps described above have been completed (see :ref:`youtrack_preinstall` ).
Failure to do so will lead the rock-on to a continuous "restart loop" that may
be difficult to correct from Rockstor webUI.

.. image:: /images/interface/docker-based-rock-ons/youtrack_install.png
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

Click the **Install** button next to the YouTrack listing on the Rock-ons page.
You will first be asked to choose a dedicated share for each volume. You can
thus choose all four shares that we created previously with the correct
ownership.

    :width: 100%
    :align: center

Next, you can simply leave the default port for the webUI as pre-filled by
Rockstor. On the next window, verify all settings are correct and click
"*Submit*". Following the settings above, we have the following:

.. _youtrack_first_boot:

First access to YouTrack UI
----------------------------

Upon first installation, the YouTrack rock-on will proceed with its
initialization  and configuration. While most of this is automated and
completed through an easy-to-use interface, a token generated during
installation needs to be retrieved. This can be done with:

     # cat /mnt2/youtrack-conf/internal/services/configurationWizard/wizard_token.txt

We can now click on the **YouTrack UI** button and start the initialization
process.

.. image:: /images/interface/docker-based-rock-ons/youtrack_installed.png
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

First, the YouTrack initialization and configuration will ask for the token we
just gathered above.

.. pull-quote::
    Note that the initialization process at first install can take quite some
    time. Fortunately, the YouTrack UI will greet you with a proper screen
    informing you as such. The screen will update automatically once it is
    ready to proceed.


.. image:: /images/interface/docker-based-rock-ons/youtrack_token.png

   :align: center

After clicking the **Log in** button, you can then proceed with the rest of
YouTrack's configuration process as desired.

.. _youtrack_upgrade:

Upgrading from a previous version
----------------------------------

While upgrading from a previous installation of YouTrack is possible, it
is recommended to follow the *Backup* / *Restore* procedure as detailed in
YouTrack's documentation. We refer the user to the `Upgrade an Existing Installation ...
<https://www.jetbrains.com/help/youtrack/server/upgrade-with-docker-image.html#youtrack-zip-msi-to-docker>`_,
which provides detailed step-by-step instructions.
