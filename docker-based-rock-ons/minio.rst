MinIO Rock-on
=================

Before you install MinIO, you should understand the prerequisites
and configurations common to all Rockstor :ref:`rockons_intro`;
specifically the :ref:`rockons_preinstall` and :ref:`rockons_root`
requirement.


.. _minio_whatis:

What is MinIO
-----------------

`MinIO <https://min.io>`_ is an open-source, high-performance, distributed S3-compatible 
object storage system.  MinIO can scale from a single server with a single object store 
all the way to a fault-tolerant commercial-grade distributed infrastrucure.  This MinIO 
Rock-on targets the low end, creating a single MinIO server using a single Rockstor
share as its object store.  This configuration should be perfect for catching backups on 
a home server, for example.

This MinIO Rock-on does not implement encryption.  If connections between the client and 
the MinIO server traverse a network lacking physical security, consider either using a 
VPN or putting MinIO behind a reverse proxy for encryption. Implementing 
native encryption in the MinIO Rock-on, although possible, would require post-installation 
configuration and on-going certificate management in addition to the MinIO Rock-on 
installation. This would violate the '"all-in-one" user experience' guideline in 
:ref:`contributerockons`.

MinIO Documentation
-----------------------

If you want a deep dive into the full range of MinIO capabilities, the MinIO
project maintains extensive, well-written `documentation <https://docs.min.io/>`_
covering many different deployment models.  You don't need to worry about all
that to use this Rock-on, though.  Simply point your MinIO-enabled client at the
URL for your server (``http://domain-name:port``) and use the Access Key
(username) and Secret Key (password) that you specified during installation.


.. _minio_install:

Installing MinIO Rock-on
----------------------------
The MinIO Rock-on requires a Rockstor share to use as the object store.
You should create this share in a pool with sufficient space for your needs 
before beginning the MinIO Rock-on installation.

Once your share is ready, click the "Install" button next to the MinIO listing on 
the Rock-ons page.

.. _minio_environment:

MinIO Environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
MinIO needs values for three environment variables.  "Web Portal Access" set to "on" 
provides a basic Web interface for creating and deleting storage objects on the MinIO 
server.  "MinIO Access Key" and "MinIO Secret Key" are the username and password you 
will use on the Web interface and in your S3-compatible client software.

MinIO Installation Successful
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Congratulations!  You can use the "MinIO UI" button to go to the Web 
management interface to view and create storage objects, and you can point 
your S3-compatible application at your new server.  The Web interface and 
the S3-compatible interface share the same port and can be used simultaneously.
