Distribution update from 15.5 to 15.6
=====================================

Rockstor installs "Built on openSUSE" Leap 15.5 - **End of Life (EOL) December 2024** - can be *distribution updated*.
This How-to includes instruction on moving an existing 15.5 based install over, **in-place**,
to the next major version of our base OS.
Only one major version jump must be attempted at any one time.
If your Rockstor install is not based on 15.5, consider one of our other "Distribution update ..." How-tos.

- **A minimum Rockstor version of 4.6.1-0 (stable) or 5.0.15-0 (testing) is recommended before attempting this OS update.**

.. note::

    There are always less unknowns for fresh installs.
    It is advisable to consider a fresh-start via the latest **Recommended** Rockstor installer.
    See `Downloads <https://rockstor.com/dls.html>`_ for the available options.
    See also our :ref:`installer_howto`.

    Existing :ref:`pools` and :ref:`config_backup` files remain compatible and importable.

.. warning::

    For both **in-place** and **re-install/import** approaches; always ensure all backups are refreshed.
    For re-install/import all data on a re-used system disk ('ROOT' Pool) will be irreversibly destroyed.
    Alternatively use a fresh system disk to provide a fail over of reverting to the original system disk.
    Do not attach both old and new system disks simultaneously.
    Only one Rockstor system disk must be attached at any one time.

Before attempting an **in-place** distribution update, be sure that you have applied all regular updates first.
The :ref:`updating_rockstor` section covers how to do this either via the Web-UI or via the command line.

.. _155_156-overview:

Overview
--------

This **Distribution Update** procedure is well established in our upstream base OS of openSUSE Leap.
Below we detail the following steps, each in their own sections:

- Update Rockstor's public key
- Update repositories
- Distribution update
- Reporting issues

See our FAQ entry :ref:`faq_rockstor4_repos` for more context.

.. _155_156-update_repo_key:

Update Rockstor's public key
----------------------------

Rockstor's repo and rpm package signing key was expiration extended in May 2025.
Ensure the latest version is installed via:

.. code-block:: console

    rpm --erase gpg-pubkey-5f043187
    rpm --import https://rockstor.com/ROCKSTOR-GPG-KEY

.. _155_156-update_repos:

Update repositories
-------------------

Here we stream edit/replace all :code:`15.5` and :code:`15_5` instances with :code:`15.6` and :code:`15_6` respectively via:

.. code-block:: console

    sed -i 's/15_5/15_6/g' /etc/zypp/repos.d/*.repo
    sed -i 's/15\.5/15\.6/g' /etc/zypp/repos.d/*.repo

.. note::

    This does not change the repository configuration file names themselves.
    This is not important and can serve as an indicator of a system's history/origin.
    The filenames for these repositories are cosmetic only.

.. _155_156-distro-update:

Distribution update
-------------------

**Double check all repositories are as-expected.**
The following command should output a very similar list of repositories to those indicated.
:ref:`Rockstor-Testing <testing_channel>` may be replaced by :ref:`Rockstor-Stable <stable_channel>`, or neither may be present;
depending on your :ref:`update channel selection <update_channels>`

.. code-block:: console

    zypper --releasever=15.6 lr -U

Before the big **Distribution Update**
we must import all the new repository keys and information from all of the changes made above.

.. code-block:: console

    zypper --releasever=15.6 --non-interactive --gpg-auto-import-keys refresh

And finally the actual base OS update itself.
Here we instruct zypper to download all packages first.
This helps to avoid a download failure part-way through this rather sensitive process.

The download size plus the extra disk space required will be around 600 MiB.
So ensure that you have at least 2 GB free on your system disk ('ROOT' Pool), before proceeding.

.. note::

    N.B. in the following step we are changing the legs upon which the entire system is running,
    it is best to have the system under as minimal load as possible.
    As such it is advisable to close any Rockstor Web-UI browser tabs during this process.

.. warning::

    It is imperative that the system is not rebooted during this process.
    It is also important to reboot the system after the following
    "zypper ... dup ..." command has completed.
    This enables the new legs to be the ones running the show.
    **Upstream reference**:
    `SDB:System upgrade <https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:System_upgrade>`_

.. code-block:: console

    zypper --releasever=15.6 dup --download-in-advance --allow-vendor-change --no-recommends


.. note::
    The following **Problems** / **packaging conflicts** have been observed & reported.
    Compare your own systems output to identify which `Solution #` to pick:

.. code-block:: console

    Problem: 1: the to be installed libopenssl-1_1-devel-1.1.1w-150600.3.10.x86_64 conflicts with 'libopenssl-devel > 1.1.1w' provided by the to be installed libopenssl-devel-3.1.4-150600.2.1.noarch
     Solution 1: Following actions will be done:
      keep obsolete libopenssl-1_1-devel-1.1.1l-150500.17.28.2.x86_64
      keep obsolete libopenssl-devel-1.1.1l-150400.1.5.noarch
      keep obsolete openssl-1.1.1l-150400.1.5.noarch
      keep obsolete openssl-1_1-1.1.1l-150500.17.28.2.x86_64
     Solution 2: deinstallation of libopenssl-1_1-devel-1.1.1l-150500.17.28.2.x86_64
     Solution 3: deinstallation of libopenssl-devel-1.1.1l-150400.1.5.noarch

    Choose from above solutions by number or cancel [1/2/3/c/d/?] (c):

If you see the above message: it is currently advised to choose **Solution 2**.

.. code-block:: console

    Problem: 1: the to be installed libopenssl-1_1-devel-1.1.1w-150600.3.10.x86_64 conflicts with ‘libopenssl-devel > 1.1.1w’ provided by the to be installed libopenssl-devel-3.1.4-150600.2.1.noarch
     Solution 1: Following actions will be done:
      keep obsolete libopenssl-1_1-devel-1.1.1l-150500.17.28.2.x86_64
      keep obsolete libopenssl-devel-1.1.1l-150400.1.5.noarch
      keep obsolete openssl-1.1.1l-150400.1.5.noarch
      keep obsolete openssl-1_1-1.1.1l-150500.17.28.2.x86_64
     Solution 2: Following actions will be done:
      deinstallation of libopenssl-devel-1.1.1l-150400.1.5.noarch
      deinstallation of postgresql13-llvmjit-devel-13.15-150200.5.58.1.x86_64
     Solution 3: deinstallation of libopenssl-1_1-devel-1.1.1l-150500.17.28.2.x86_64

    Choose from above solutions by number or cancel [1/2/3/c/d/?] (c):

If you see the above message: it is currently advised to choose **Solution 3**.

For both of the above, the sole listed action is the same:

.. code-block:: console

    ... deinstallation of libopenssl-1_1-devel-1.1.1l-150500.17.28.2.x86_64

**Favour your system's `Solution #` containing this same single action.**

We use --allow-vendor-change as some prior openSUSE packages are now supplied directly from SuSE.
The --no-recommends is to keep to our JeOS (Just enough Operating System) `minimal` origin.
I.e. don't install things like manuals etc and other 'extra' packages.



To reboot from the command line once the above "zypper ... dup ..." command has finished,
enter the following commands as root:

.. code-block:: console

    sync
    reboot

Reporting issues
----------------

As always we welcome feedback to improve what we do.
So please consider reporting your experience or suggestions on our friendly
`Community Forum <https://forum.rockstor.com/>`_.

A distribution update is in many ways more complex than an entirely fresh install.
And given Rockstor's overall size a re-install can be very quick.
But if you have a complex install an in-place distribution update can be the way to go.
