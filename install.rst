Installation
============

Installation of Rockstor is a short and straight forward process. For all types
of installations, see :ref:`quickstartguide` to get started. Please also note
that we have a :ref:`pre_install`.

Quick evaluation using a virtual environment
--------------------------------------------

Rockstor can also be evaluated quickly using a virtual machine, see our  :ref:`kvmsetup`.

See YouTube `VirtualBox Rockstor install demo <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00k_RwwC5Ms>`_.

Before proceeding with a serious installation that may require hardware
procurement, you can evaluate Rockstor on Amazon AWS.

See YouTube `Rockstor on ec2 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ys_8FLVov2U>`_.

Hardware recommendations
-------------------------

There is nothing about Rockstor that requires special hardware. It's Linux, and
specifically a CentOS/Fedora fork, so it can be installed on a wide range of
commodity hardware. See :ref:`minsysreqs` for basic requirements.

Over time, the Rockstor developers and community at large share hardware specs
that are known to work with Rockstor. Below is a list of these recommendations.
Please note, however, that the following examples are to be taken as
illustrations of possible builds at the time of writing and will likely be
rapidly outpaced by the rapidly evolving hardware market. We always recommend
visiting our `Forum <http://forum.rockstor.com>`_ for user stories, example
builds, and request advice on hardware choice or recommendations.

Complete Builds for Home and small organizations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can find user stories and example builds on our
`Forum <http://forum.rockstor.com>`_, but some excerpts are listed below:

1. A build used by Rockstor developers and at least some known
   community members uses `ASRock C2550D4I
   <https://www.asrockrack.com/general/productdetail.asp?Model=C2550D4I>`_
   with `this memory
   <http://www.kingston.com/us/memory/search/?partid=kvr16le11/8>`_. The
   motherboard provides 12 SATA ports, so `this
   <https://www.silverstonetek.com/product.php?pid=452>`_ is a recommended tower
   case to hold up to 12 hard drives.

2. Yet another recommendation used by Rockstor team is `HP Microserver
   <http://www8.hp.com/us/en/products/proliant-servers/product-detail.html?oid=5379860>`_. Note
   that the link refers to gen8 which may be in use by some community members,
   but gen7 is the one in use by the Rockstor team.

Upgrading Rockstor
------------------
Rockstor is under continuous development and we push tested updates in small batches. These updates are easy to install. While we roll-out major releases that require complete OS install, we try to make these releases as infrequent as possible. We strive to make most updates non-disruptive.

Rockstor updates can be installed in two ways :

1. Install updates from the Web-UI : On the Rockstor Web-UI, on the top-right side of the navigation bar, you will see an upward facing arrow. If you click on that arrow, and if there is an update available, you will see *Software Update* highlighted, with details on the screen.

See YouTube `How to keep Rockstor upto date <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srn6vgQNkbc>`_.

2. Install updates from the CLI : You can safely update Rockstor anytime with the
following command::

    [root@localhost ~]# yum update rockstor

If an update is disruptive, the update process prompts for user action and
provides the necessary information to choose to update or not. You can safely
decide not to update if that makes sense for your environment.
